### user-app-client

## Setup
See the .env.example for needed .env-variables to run the system locally. Some of the submodules needs their own .env file, but to make it much easier for you the bashscript system.bash will take care of it for you. See the individual repos for more detail if needed. To set up the .env files and start the system run the command:

```
./setup.bash up --env
```

You can also skip the --env flag if you already have the needed .env-files and just run:

```
./setup.bash up
```

This will build all the docker-containers and start the system.

## Teardown
Just use the following command to stop the system, shut down the docker-network and remove all images that was built during setup. 

```
./setup.bash down
```
